NOTE:

bash vs tmux:
tmux isnt a separate terminal, but rather a terminal multiplexer that runs ontop of the bash shell:

Start from the basics:

Kernel: The core of the operating system.
it schedules cpu time, memory allocation, etc
NOTE: programs do not interact directly with hardware! instead they query the kernel to do it for them via system calls
(calls directly to the kernel)


Shell: a program that lets you control the operating system (reads your commands and starts programs)
Exe:
launches programs like python, ssh, or other things like that (which are executables btw)
piping / redirection: cat a | grep x > out.txt 
managed environment variables like PATH and HOME (more or that later)
common examples like bash or zsh

Terminal:
The window that displays the text input/output.

All together: opening a terminal opens a text session (PTY)
That starts your shell (zsh / bash)
shell runs commands like python or ssh
these commands ask the kernel to do work for them (ie allocate me some memory and compute this for me)


Now, lets give a FULL view of what happens when you type something in the terminal:
exe, when I write "echo 'hello world'" how does that output on my screen hello world?

First, a few more definitions:

process: 
The running program (its code) PLUS

An Address Space, which is just the virtual memory adresses that were given to the process for use PLUS
kernel-managed resourses (like open files, or sockets)
Note: when running a program, two types of resources: user space resources adn kernel space resources
Files, when opened, are put in a kernel file table that has an associated file descriptor (which is given to teh program)
alongside other stuff like current file offset, perms, and the actual file contents in a buffer somewhere
