Goal of reverse engineering is to go from executable -> code to figure out what
it does.

xxd sorting. to open the file to see what is inside of the binay

Notice: while most of the program isnt readable, some of it is, and the
strings are still there adn can 

To get better view of the strings:
strings -n 10 /path/to/file.etf | less #displays all length of 10 longer strings:
strings sorting r

what does this program do:

__PAGEZERO  #in macos, compiled binaries have pagezero, place in memory starts with address 0 (not readable/writable/exec)
(exists to catch null pts)
__unwind_info
__PAGEZERO
__PAGEZERO
__PAGEZERO
__PAGEZERO
__unwind_info
__DATA_CONST
__DATA_CONST
__LINKEDIT #liekly from the linker
/usr/lib/dyld #dynamic linker
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
We want to find the position of the element 10 in the array. 
The position we found is index %d
But this took a lot of time, which can be done more simply with binary search
Using Binary Search, we obtain the same index of %d
First element is now %d
Last element is now %d

glibc is a compiler for c


2: disassemble into assembly / pseudoC
objdump -d -Mintel ./sorting | less #tells us exactly what cpu asked to do
-d for disassemble 
-S for source, to interwieve c source (works for linux, not wsl where executables are windows style)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential binutils gdb
(build essentials give you gcc, make, stuff like that)
(binutils gives you objdump, nm ld, etc)

gcc -g -O0 main.c -o main (-g adds debug into, needed for source interleaving, and -O0 turns off optimization, so can easy match)

Now, assembly is very hard to read and understand, so people at IDA made it work into pseudoC
